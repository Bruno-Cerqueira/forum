# CONTROLLER TEST

Test the controller layer is a little complicated because this layer is the biggest and more important for an api application. We can split the responsibilities in 6 parts:

1. Verifying HTTP Request Matching
2. Verifying Input Deserialization
3. Verifying Input Validation
4. Verifying Business Logic Calls
5. Verifying Output Serialization
6. Verifying Exception Handling
